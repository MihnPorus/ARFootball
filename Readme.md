# AR Football

## Idea
How about the feeling that a cameraman hold the camera to follow the player in the game.

I think no one will get it, in a real game. Because it is not allowed in the real game.

This feeling is this ar application want to give you.

## Roadmap


## How To Play
1. Put the play ground picture on your desktop
2. Stand up
3. Hold your phone (for now it is only supported Android, other oses in the fulture), to the ground picture
4. Start Gaming
